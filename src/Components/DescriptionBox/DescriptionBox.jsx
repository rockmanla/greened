            <p>Meet the newest member of your houseplants family. Houseplants come in all shapes, sizes and styles and we have a huge variety of indoor plants in our shop. So take a good look around and choose the plants that will be the perfect additions to your home.</p>
            <p>The baby Pilea Peperomioides is a low stress plant. With a splash of water once a week and some organic PLNTS nutrition every two weeks you will make this pancake plant very happy. If you want a fuller plant, cut off some of the small side shoots in the pot and put them in water. When there are enough roots on the stem you can add them to the pot, digging a little hole for them. They will quickly root and grow!
