    description: "The Syngonium Albo Variegata is a beautiful little plant with arrow-shaped leaves. She has a spectacular collection of colours on her leaves, varying from dark greens to bold whites. To make sure you can always see her striking colours, be sure to place her in a nice light spot and they will stay that way. This rare plant doesn't have many demands and is a fantastic resident that will always be the centre of conversation. This RarePLNT might come with a leaf that has been partially cut. This has been done for propagation and is not harmful to the plant."

    description: "The Rhaphidophora Tetrasperma, like the Monstera Deliciosa, has an interesting leaf shape, which is why they are often confused with each other. The difference is that the leaves of the Rhaphidophora Tetrasperma stay a lot smaller, and the plant is a lot easier to care for. It is a fast growing plant that grows best as soon as it can grow against something."

    old_price: 11.45,
    description: "If you are looking for an easy to care for plant that is more on the special side, the Sansevieria Trifasciata is your girl! She is a snake plant with upright leaves that have a silverish tint to them. She earned a fitting nickname due to her colour, which is ‘Moonshine’. This type of snake plant is less common, which makes her a nice addition to your collection!"

    new_price: 12.95,
    old_price: 14.95,
    description: "The Sansevieria Fernwood Mikado is an adorable, spikey lady that owes her name ‘Mikado’ to the old-school game. She doesn’t require much care as she originally lives in the desert, so she is used to little water. She differs from other plants as she has really cool upright cylindrical leaves that end in a point at the top. Her tough tiger-striped pattern makes her special appearance complete."
