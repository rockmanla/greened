    description: "Schismatoglottis Wallichii is an elegant plant and also rare. She stands out for her beautiful leaf markings. Her leaves have a pointed shape and are decorated with a pale green, almost silvery stripe on either side of the plant's vein. That silvery stripe looks like it was painted on with a brush. That markings only get more beautiful as the plant grows up. You don't come across leaf markings like that very often! Will you be adopting this work of art? Buy Schismatoglottis Wallichii online. "

    description: "If you are looking for an easy to care for plant that is more on the special side, the Sansevieria Trifasciata is your girl! She is a snake plant with upright leaves that have a silverish tint to them. She earned a fitting nickname due to her colour, which is ‘Moonshine’. This type of snake plant is less common, which makes her a nice addition to your collection!"

    description: "The Sansevieria Fernwood Mikado is an adorable, spikey lady that owes her name ‘Mikado’ to the old-school game. She doesn’t require much care as she originally lives in the desert, so she is used to little water. She differs from other plants as she has really cool upright cylindrical leaves that end in a point at the top. Her tough tiger-striped pattern makes her special appearance complete."

This fierce lady originates in the tropical forests of America and the Caribbean, and is a popular houseplant. In need of a tropical jungle vibe at home?

    description: "Here is the most beloved and rare Thai Constellation. To make her even more desirable, this is the cute baby form! She earns her name on her variegation that looks like a constellation. In contrast to most variegated plants, the Thai’s variegation is stable, yay! This is because she was especially produced for this, which also means that you will not be able to find this cutie anywhere in nature. All with all, a very special plant that would love a spot inside your urban jungle!"

    description: "We would like you to meet a rare plant species… This is the Philodendron Ring of Fire! She is highly desired by PLNTSlovers around the world, including ourselves! Look at her, isn’t she absolutely phenomenal?! Long narrow frayed leaves that are covered with cream or even orange variegation. This orange colour is also where she got her name from, which we think fits her perfectly. And the best thing of all, she isn’t fussy to look after at all, yaay!"

    description: "The baby Monstera Deliciosa is a large, popular and lush plant often called a Swiss cheese plant, on account of her leaves which are full of large holes. The Monstera is a strong, powerful vine that grows easily, and in her native South American jungles she grows many meters tall. If long strings grow out of your Monstera Deliciosa, don’t worry- these are aerial roots. In the jungle they are used to cling to trees and branches, but in your home they are not needed so you can cut them off or lead them back to the potting soil. And don’t be fooled by her small size- keep her happy and she’ll grow fast!"
